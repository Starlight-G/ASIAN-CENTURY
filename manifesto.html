    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <p><strong>We believe this century belongs to Asia — not by default, but by design.</strong></p>

    <p>Asia is home to over 4.5 billion people, to some of the fastest-growing economies, and to a cultural, technological, and diplomatic renaissance that will shape the 21st century.</p>

    <p>This is a platform to imagine, build, and lead that future — not passively, but actively. It is a call for bold youth leadership, responsible innovation, transnational collaboration, and regional imagination.</p>

    <p>From the mountains of Ladakh to the streets of Seoul, from the classrooms of Jakarta to the tech parks of Shenzhen — this movement belongs to you. To us.</p>

    <p><strong>This is not a manifesto of what is. It’s a declaration of what could be.</strong></p>

    <p>We are not waiting for permission. We are stepping forward — to shape an Asia that leads with wisdom, tech, empathy, and future foresight.</p>

    <p>Let this website be the first proof. Let this manifesto be our shared vision.</p>

    <p><em>Because this century doesn't just belong to Asia. It belongs to the ones who dare to believe it does.</em></p>
